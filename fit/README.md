## Model library installation

To install the `kws` package, you can run the following command:

```
pip install -e "git+https://github.com/akinwilson/heed.git#egg=kws&subdirectory=models"
```

**NOTE**: `egg=PACKAGE_NAME` where `PACKAGE_NAME` needs to be replaced with our python library name, and `subdirectory=SUB_DIRECTORY_NAME` needs to be replaced with the subdirectory containing the python library.
